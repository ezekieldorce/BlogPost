*Today I learned how to use the command line to make, redirect, find and
 delete various items in the Terminal. We also made a nano file (like this

   <p>Today I learned how to use HTML code to access files, while also implementing the command line in order to use VSC, allowing me to change this retros.txt file to an html. Not to mention formatting images into our files to make them appear within our files.</p>

 Today I learned how to use GitHub to commit and save my files, while also using CSS as a reference in my HTML file.
